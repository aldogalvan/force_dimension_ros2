# Force Dimension ROS2 package

This package implements a simple ROS2 node for interfacing with Force Dimension 
[haptics] robots, with the objective of simplifying the process of developing 
applications involving haptic devices. For further background information, 
please see the internal documentation related to
[Force Dimension](doc/markdown/force_dimension.md) and 
[ROS](doc/markdown/ros.md).

This package has been tested with [ROS2 Galactic], [ROS2 Humble], and 
[ROS2 Iron]. It has been tested with Ubuntu Linux and Microsoft Windows, as 
well as Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

## Getting started

Ensure that the package is properly [installed](doc/markdown/installation.md) 
and that the robots are [calibrated](doc/markdown/calibration.md). The package 
can then be used -- in a [configured ROS2 environment] -- like any other 
[ROS2 package]. For example, a Force Dimension server node can be invoked and 
queried from the [command line](doc/markdown/command_line.md).

When designing client nodes that can interact with the Force Dimension server 
node, the [Python example](doc/markdown/python_client_example.md) is a good 
place to start. The example can be invoked with a single command:

```bash
> ros2 launch force_dimension example.launch.py
```

Also see the documentation related to the 
[topics](doc/markdown/topics.md) and [parameters](doc/markdown/parameters.md) 
associated with the ROS2 node.

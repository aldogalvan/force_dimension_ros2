### Linux dependencies

The Force Dimension SDK has some dependencies. Some packages might be missing, and this will be reported via errors during the build (although error messages are not always straightforward, and some research might be required). Depending on the local system, the following installation commands might need to be executed:

```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install libxrender-dev
sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt install libxrandr-dev
sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```
